# GroundItemClear
### A plugin for CraftBukkit 1060 that automatically clears ground items to reduce lag. 

### Usage:
To set the interval between item clear passes, edit the plugin's `config.yml`.

Commands:
  * `/gic help`: Display the plugin's help screen
  * `/gic info`: Display information about the plugin
  * `/gic clear`: Clear ground items

Please note that this plugin will not receive a port for modern versions as those have superior plugins, like ClearLagg. I'm only creating this plugin because I was not able to find anything of the sort for CB 1060.
